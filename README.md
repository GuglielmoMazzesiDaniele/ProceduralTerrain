# TerrainGenerator
This repository contains a procedural generator of infinite terrain, implemented in Unity 6 using the URP. Built for [Acerola's Dirt Jam] (https://itch.io/jam/acerola-dirt-jam).
My submission can be found [here](https://mobaster.itch.io/procedural-terrain-generator).

Below is a showcase of the implementation
